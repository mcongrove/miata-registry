# Miata Registry

A community-driven project that aims to document and preserve the history of limited edition Mazda Miatas.

## üöó About

The Miata Registry is a public platform where owners of limited edition Mazda Miatas can register and document their vehicles. This registry helps preserve these cars' histories and builds a valuable resource for the community.

## üåü Why Register?

-   Help preserve the history of limited edition Miatas
-   Connect with other owners of limited editions
-   Verify authenticity of limited edition models
-   Track vehicles as they change hands over time
-   Contribute to the community's knowledge base

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Create an account by clicking "Sign In" at [MiataRegistry.com](https://miataregistry.com)
2. Find your car on the Registry list page and click "Claim", or (if it's not there) go to Registry > Register your Miata
3. Submit your car's details and the Miata Registry team will review your submission
4. Send any supporting documentation to support@miataregistry.com to get verified faster; this can be photos, social media links, PDF files showing vehicle history, etc.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development

To run the Miata Registry locally:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/miata-registry.git
    cd miata-registry
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.dev.vars` and `.env` file in the root directory with your environment variables. Reach out to a maintainer to get the correct values.

4. Start the development application and worker:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    npm run worker:dev
    ```

> **Note**: The local development environment connects to the production Cloudflare D1 database, KV cache, and R2 storage through local worker APIs. This ensures consistency between development and production environments while this project is in development.
