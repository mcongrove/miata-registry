			"The 1991 Special Edition represents Mazda's first special production Miata for the North American market. Limited to just 4,000 units, this edition featured a distinctive British Racing Green exterior paired with a tan leather interior, making it instantly recognizable among early NA Miatas.",
			"Each car came equipped with a unique numbered dash badge, tan vinyl top, headrest speakers, stainless steel door sills, and color-matched Nardi wooden steering wheel, shift knob, and handbrake handle. The edition also featured power windows, power steering, and a limited-slip differential as standard equipment.",
			"The combination of British Racing Green paint and tan interior was a deliberate homage to classic British sports cars, particularly those from the 1960s. This edition marked the beginning of Mazda's tradition of producing limited-run Miatas, setting a precedent for future special editions."
